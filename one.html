    <h2>What are cryptocurrencines?:</h2> 

    <h2>Cryptocurrency is a form of electronic currency that operates independently of central banking systems. This decentralised payment network allows users to send and receive funds with no third party involved.... Funds sent via a cryptocurrency are recorded in a public ledger as the transaction takes place. Digital wallets are used to store cryptocurrency.</h2>

    <h2>What are NFTs?:</h2>

    <h2>The phrase "non-fungible token" (NFT) is used to define a digital asset that cannot be exchanged for other tokens and whose ownership is recorded on a blockchain platform such as Ethereum. Non-Fiat Assets (NFAs) can be used to represent a wide variety of assets, from digital items (like those found in virtual worlds) to claims on real-world possessions (like clothing or a house). In the future, NFTs will be used to enable whole new use cases that can only be achieved with crypto.</h2>

    <h2>Although most NFT activity to date has taken place in the Ethereum environment, NFTs are not limited to Ethereum and can be implemented on any other smart contract platform. This is due to the fact that NFTs are, at their heart, essentially digital abstractions used to represent unique assets. This is a crucial technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain, but the term "non-fungible token" isn't the most intuitive because we don't usually talk about the fungibility of objects in the real world. The purpose of this piece is not to provide exhaustive coverage of every initiative in the NFT field, but rather to provide a high-level introduction to NFTs, explain why they are intriguing, and highlight some of the many ways they could be put to good use.</h2>

<h2> What makes NFTs so fascinating?:</h2>

<h2>With other financial building blocks on Ethereum, NFTs give everyone the ability to issue, hold, and exchange financial instruments. As a result, NFT interactions are far more time- and labor-saving than on conventional systems. Because of its decentralised nature and ease of transfer, cryptocurrency is a more efficient payment method than more conventional methods. Using protocols that enable the decentralised trade of NFTs, a game creator, for instance, can immediately make in-game items tradable. Having the things be marketable does not necessitate making your own marketplace or going through the registration process of a central platform. </h2>

<h2>In addition to trading, NFTs can be used for a wide variety of other purposes, including as borrowing, lending, fractional ownership (via platforms like NIFTEX), and securing loans (e.g. NFTfi). When you couple NFTs with DeFi components, you open up a world of opportunities. Aavegotchi, for instance, blends DeFi with NFT gaming by having players' Aavegotchi characters operate as collateral deposited within the Aave lending platform, while simultaneously allowing players to battle over them, level them up, and equip accessories that alter their features.

</h2>

<h2>By facilitating art NFTs, which allow for fractionalized ownership, those who might not otherwise be able to afford such a valuable object can now have a piece of it. Although a reliable custodian is still necessary for the safekeeping of a physical object, its expanded utility can be realised through its issuance, storage, and trading as a cryptoasset. An NFT can be designed so that the creator passively and automatically receives a cut of all future purchases. In the conventional art market, artists rarely see any profit from their works' subsequent sales.
</h2>

<h2>
  Another intriguing idea is programmable art, in which on-chain data is embedded within a work of art to allow for its features or attributes to be dynamically updated. If the price of ether rises above a specific amount of money, the background of a piece of programmable art may be set to reflect that. The potential for originality is practically limitless.
</h2>

<h2>
  The subject of what can be done with digital art is often asked. Digital frames allow for the presentation of these works in a traditional gallery space. Beeple, a digital artist, raised $3.5 million at an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace by selling both digital and physical tokens representing his NFTs.
</h2>

<h2>
  Online collections, such as a SuperRare profile, and virtual worlds are two more venues for showcasing digital art. Cryptovoxels is a virtual environment where users can purchase and sell land parcels using NFTs, and it also happens to house a number of art galleries. More and more people will expect to see digital artworks on exhibit at virtual reality establishments. The gaming industry is already worth billions of dollars, so this isn't too dissimilar from people spending money on in-game goods to change the look of their character.
</h2>

<h2>
  Many people doubt that this image is rare because it can easily be copied by taking a screenshot or downloading the digital file. That said, one could make a similar case for actual objects. Replicas and photographs of the Mona Lisa are easily accessible online, but they cannot replace the original work of art. Most consumers are willing to pay a premium for an authentic, one-of-a-kind product. Intriguingly, the provenance of digital works of art or collectibles may be checked with relative ease. Depending on its previous owner, the value of some digital objects may increase.
</h2>

<h2>
  NFTs also allow you to demonstrate that the product is authentic and impossible to replicate. To a certain extent, this is a problem for real-world valuables. For instance, Wayne Gretzky paid $451k for a baseball card featuring Honus Wagner. The card was later auctioned for several million dollars. Later in court, one of the card's vendors admitted that he had trimmed the corners to make them look more presentable. You may rest assured that the NFT supply will not fluctuate, and that no counterfeit or additional printing will occur. Many Black Lotus cards in Magic: The Gathering are fakes. Standard practises for checking the authenticity of a card include bending it to make sure it doesn't crease or sending it off to a centralised grading service, the rating of which has a major impact on the card's worth.
</h2>

<h2>How it relates to gaming:</h2>

<h2>To facilitate the buying and selling of virtual goods, Steam, a well-liked gaming platform, hosts a Community Market. The buyer pays a 5% transaction charge for each item purchased on Steam's centralised marketplace. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 charge a 10 percent premium on all in-game purchases.</h2>

<h2>
  Both the total value of a user's Steam Wallet and the cost of a single item are capped at $2,000 and $1,800, respectively. The DotA 2 pink war dog courier sold for $38,000, and while these examples are extreme, many in-game items can sell for much higher amounts. There have also been extremely expensive sales in the crypto realm, such as the CryptoKitty's $170,000 asking price. Like the rare and valuable Black Lotus card from Magic: The Gathering, which brought in $166,100 at auction. The need for rare or otherwise desirable in-game objects is undeniable. In a decentralised market, the quantity and price of in-game goods are not regulated by any central authority.
</h2>

<h2>
  Since launching and maintaining a decentralised marketplace is more efficient, transaction costs can be drastically reduced. The quality of the user experience and the amount of time spent playing a game can both be enhanced by using a marketplace. In 2018, Blizzard Entertainment's Hearthstone, a digital collectible card game, attracted more than 100 million players worldwide. Although Hearthstone has chosen not to offer a trading system for their cards, this opens the door for other digital collectible card games to compete in this space. Cards from both Gods Unchained and SkyWeaver can be freely traded with other players of either game. As you progress through the game, you can also collect cards. Even if a player doesn't spend money on booster packs, they can still make their decks stronger than the ones provided by the game. It's thrilling to realise that the cards you've worked so hard to collect actually have worth and can be exchanged for additional cards. Users of Gods Unchained can gain tokens for doing things like referring their friends and winning matches. The tokens itself grant access to uncommon in-game items and can be traded at will.</h2>

  <h2> Axie Infinity has quickly become one of the most played crypto games. Using a squad of Axies as pets, you engage in combat and advance in level. It's not immediately obvious that you're playing a blockchain game, but you can take advantage of open trading for Axies on NFT platforms like OpenSea. Since its release, the game has become immensely popular in the Philippines, and players may now make a living playing it, with token earnings often surpassing the minimum wage in many nations. Players who wish to try out the game but don't have the money to buy an Axiom can rent one through a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) called Yield Guild Games. And for a grand sum of $159,000, many extremely rare Axies were purchased.</h2>

  <h2> Another well-liked game is Dark Forest, in which players travel to new worlds in search of Artifact NFTs, which, when attached to a planet, grant perks to the player. Finding and collecting these objects, or winning them in combat, and then trading them in decentralised marketplaces can add a lot of depth and variety to the gaming experience. The option to trade in-game things raises the question of whether or not this will have a negative impact on the overall game experience, as players may become more preoccupied with making a profit off the system or only those willing to spend a lot of money on products will be able to play. Players in Diablo III could visit the auction house to sell and buy virtual items using real-world money. Due to its negative impact on the game, it was disabled. Since players could just buy the best loot, it ceased to be enjoyable and rewarding. Diablo III's auction house had a significant impact on gameplay because collecting the best loot was a major part of the game, but in other games this is not the case. Developers need to strike a balance in deciding which game elements should be tradable (e.g. skins rather than weapons, game time itself can be traded, etc).</h2>
