<h2>
  As a new field, social tokens experienced explosive growth in 2020. Tokens produced by individuals or groups are collectively known as "social tokens." There are a number of synonyms for this phrase, all of which are included below. Since no agreed-upon word exists yet, I shall use the term "social tokens" to refer to the overarching concept. It's thrilling that social tokens give producers and communities a greater stake in what they're making.

<h2>
  Experiments with social tokens began with people "tokenizing" their time. For instance, Reuben Bramanathan, a former legal and product manage r at Coinbase, has tokenized his time such that one $CSNL token is equivalent to one hour of his time and can be freely traded. People were also attempting to tokenize a portion of their future earnings. Roll and Coinvise are two examples of services that streamline the process of issuing a custom token.
</h2>

<h2>
  Grammy-winning musician RAC has created a Zora-based community coin called $RAC, which is a social token. Early access to goods drops and a secret Discord channel are only the beginning of the goodies for token holders. His patrons on Bandcamp and Patreon, as well as those who purchased merchandise, were among the first to receive the token. Eventually, all of his Twitch patrons will receive tokens. Authors can now communicate with their first backers in person and give them special rewards.
</h2>

<h2>
  Collab.Land, which developed a bot for Telegram and Discord that links to an Ethereum wallet to check token balance before entering a chat group, was one of the tools that allowed for a new wave of social tokens. Token permissioned groups, like $JAMM and $KARMA with their native tokens, were thus able to be created, with the goal of ensuring that group members had some stake in the outcome of the group's activities. Collab.Land also has a contribution scoreboard to recognise those who have made the most meaningful contributions in a group chat setting. It's possible that the most active users might be rewarded with tokens for their efforts.
</h2>

<h2>
  Unite Community is another helpful social token solution since it facilitates the simple distribution of tokens to followers via social media platforms and the easy reward of involvement. The versatility of social tokens is what makes them so intriguing; they may stand in for anything from a person's time to a right to use a specialised resource to the shared ownership of a group. I believe that many more producers will issue social tokens in the near future due to the enormous potential of these tokens.
